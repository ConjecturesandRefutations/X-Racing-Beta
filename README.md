# X-Racing
X-Racing is a 'Vanilla' JavaScript Canvas car racing game. 
Originally I intended this to be a desktop/laptop only game that only uses the keyboard. But I quickly realised that the market demands mobile functionality. I therefore added touchstart and touchend buttons for mobile controls. Making it mobile-friendly drove up the interest in the game to an immeasurable extent.
I really love this game. It is addictively simple.
